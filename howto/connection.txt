Error: 
Android Install on Device Failure [INSTALL_CANCELED_BY_USER]

Android Studio:
File->Settings->Build,Execution,Deployment->Instant Run -> Disable

Android:
Settings->About Phone->MIUI Version = click 7 Times
Settings->Additional Settings->Developer options->Install via USB = ON
Settings->Additional Settings->Developer options->Debbug->Verify apps over USB = ON
Settings->Additional Settings->Privacy->Unknown Sources option = ON



leave my one-line methods as i've typed them when reformating code:
File > Settings > Editor > Code Style > Java
Wrapping and Braces tab
Keep when reformatting section
Turn on the Simple methods in one line checkbox
And it just go fine!
